  **"Pioneering the use of multi-sensor foundation models to perform low-shot, high-accuracy landscape classification through 64-dimensional semantic embeddings."**

  **Project Overview:**  
  This repository explores the next frontier of Earth Observation: **Satellite Embeddings**. By utilizing Google's AlphaEarth Foundations model, this project transitions from pixel-based spectral analysis to semantically rich, AI-generated feature vectors that capture complex spatial and temporal context.

  **Technical Highlights:**
  *   **Embedding Extraction:** Leveraging the 64-band global embedding collection to bypass traditional feature engineering (like NDVI/NDBI) and work with compressed, information-dense semantics.
  *   **Low-Shot Learning:** Implementing supervised classification (Random Forest/kNN) that achieves superior accuracy with significantly fewer training labels than traditional methods.
  *   **Semantic Segmentation:** Utilizing the embeddings' inherent spatial context to classify complex land-use categories, overcoming noise and sensor artifacts.
  *   **Model Comparison:** Evaluating the performance of Foundation Model embeddings versus traditional multi-spectral workflows in diverse urban and ecological environments.
  
  **Planning Application:**  
  Revolutionizes **Rapid Urban Mapping** and monitoring in data-poor regions, allowing planners to generate high-quality LULC maps with minimal ground-truth data, accelerating the pace of evidence-based city management.
